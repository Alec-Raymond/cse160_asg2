I went for all of the points.
- For my non-cube primitive I have a sphere which I used as eyes.
- Shift click to annoy the crab!
- Drag the mouse on the canvas to rotate. I removed the rotate slider as a result, but it is still in my code commented out.
- The pinchers are the third level joint, with the arms as the second level joint and the body as the first level joint.
- Performance on my machine is very steady on chrome, well above 10 fps
